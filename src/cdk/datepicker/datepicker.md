The datepicker CDK provides a foundation upon which more concrete Material datepicker implementations can be built. The
datepicker CDK will be a generic datepicker with all of the necessary basic datepicker functionality needed for the
definition of a datepicker. Users will be able to extend this datepicker CDK with all of the basic datepicker
functionality as well as create their own views of the calendar. In this way, the users will be able to customized the
datepicker to allow for more flexibility when utilizing the datepicker component in applications.

### Behavior captured by CdkDatepicker
The Datepicker CDK has a CalendarView component with five components:
 * The date at which the datepicker will start at. The default value for this date is the current date.
 * The minimum date that the datepicker can access. The default value for this is NULL. The user can clamp the date
 values by adding an input to the calendar.
 * The maximum date that the datepicker can access. The default value for this is NULL. The user can clamp the date
 values by adding an input to the calendar.
 * The selected date of the datepicker. The default value for this is NULL. When the user provides input to the
 calendar, the selected date will change accordingly.
 * The selected change event that fires when the selected date of the datepicker has changed.

The material calendar that the user implements will then extend this CalendarView component and implement all of its
abstract fields. The different views that the user implements for the calendar (ex. month, year, etc.) will also extend
this CalendarView component and implement all of its abstract fields.

The CalendarView component is a Child of the datepicker component. Whenever the date is changed, the datepicker will
notify the CalendarView component through the datepicker input component and update all of the information within the
datepicker accordingly.

The datepicker has one input, the date at which the datepicker will start at. The user-defined material datepicker
component will extend the CDK with the properties needed.

The datepicker input component provides all inputs and events needed for the datepicker. The user-defined material
datepicker input component will also extend the CDK with the properties needed.
